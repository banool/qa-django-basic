# Basic Q&A app for Django

This is just an extremely basic anonymous Q&A thingy, inspired by [Bill Wurtz'](http://www.billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html). 

See [https://qa.dport.me](https://qa.dport.me) for a working example.

Currently you can't answer the questions without the admin page.

## To do
I want to implement:
- Rate limiting.
- A way to answer the questions without using the admin page.
- Notifying the site owner when they receive a question.
- Notifying the person who asked a question when it is answered (this would of course preclude anonymity).
- A nicer looking page.

I want to keep it simple throughout all of this, without any rating systems or anything like that.
